	To create a DuctileGraph object and to connect to DuctileDB storage, use the DuctileGraphFactory: 
      </p>
      <highlighter lang="java">
DuctileGraph graph = DuctileGraphFactory.createGraph(
    ZOOKEEPER_HOST,
    ZOOKEEPER_PORT,
    MASTER_HOST,
    MASTER_PORT);
      </highlighter>
      <p>
	As parameters the host and port for Zookeeper and HBase Master are needed. If you have a look into the JavaDoc, you find that DuctileDBGraphFactory has more factory method which can be used to connect.
