      <h1>Use DuctileDB Graph</h1>
      <p>
	To create a DuctileDBGraph object and to connect to DuctileDB storage, use the DuctileDBGraphFactory: 
      </p>
      <highlighter lang="java">
DuctileDBGraph graph = DuctileDBGraphFactory.createGraph(
    ZOOKEEPER_HOST,
    ZOOKEEPER_PORT,
    MASTER_HOST,
    MASTER_PORT);
      </highlighter>
      <p>
	As parameters the host and port for Zookeeper and HBase Master are needed. If you have a look into the JavaDoc, you find that DuctileDBGraphFactory has more factory method which can be used to connect.
