Ductile DB is a graph database based on Hadoop/HBase which provides a vast set of features inspired by link:http://neo4j.com/[Neo4j] and link:http://titan.thinkaurelius.com[Titan] graph databases:

- Full support of link:https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/Property-Graph-Model[Property Graphs]
- Support of multiple labels on nodes
- link:https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki[Blue Print] interface implementation (not supporting labels)
- Implementation of link:https://github.com/buschmais/extended-objects[eXtended Objects]
- Support for large graphs due to usage of link:http://hbase.apache.org[HBase] on link:http://hadoop.apache.org[Hadoop Distributed File System]

The project was started, because for the link:http://purifinity.com[Purifinity] (not published, yet) project a database was needed to support the large, but fine grained amount of data in a propery graph.

General information about the project can be found at:
